# Background:
Hiper is a music and sound vidualizer app that combines visuals with sounds. It can be used to interact with sound and music. The idea is coming from the fancy visual effects from EDM concerts. 


# Functionality & MVPs:
With this Hiper app, users will be able to:
- Interact with Hiperr shapes by simply talking through laptop microphone.
- Seeing how Hiper react to the built-in music tracks. 
- Playing music with outside devices (cellphone, speakers ets) and users will be able to see how Hiper shapes response to the outside sounds.
- Acutally "see" the music beats through Hiper shapes.

# Technologies, Libraries, APIs:
- The Canvas API to create and render the shapes on the browser.
- Web Audio API for external sound input. 
- Webpack to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code

* all pictures of shapes will be able to move when the app is finished.
- A production README.
- An About describing the background and the functionality of Hiper app.
- Nav links include links to this project's Github repo, live Hiper app link, as well as my own website.


# Implementation Timeline:
- Friday & Weekend: 
  * Setup the tools for the project, including getting webpack and canvas running and showing up on the screen 
  * pend time getting comfortable with the Canvas API. Create Javascript files, HTML files, and CSS files, establishing the background of the app. 
  * Creating shapes and implementing the underlying algorithms for the shapes to move. Making sure this is all rendered correctly on the canvas.
- Monday: Creating more shapes that are different in look but have the same functionality. Focus on how to connect the shapes to music and sound. 
- Tuesady: Finish the frames and focus on styling as well as testing the connection between music and the shapes. 
- Wednesday: Uploading to GitHub pages. Rewrite this proposal as a production README.

# Bonus:
If I still have time, my own songs will be connected to the app and being played while demostrate the app.
