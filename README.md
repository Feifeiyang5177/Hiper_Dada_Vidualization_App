# Background
Hiper is a sound visualization app that connects visual effects with sounds and music. It can be used for (but not limited to) immersive environments such as concerts, exhibitions, virtual music and art activities, interior design and so on. The idea was come from the visual effects in EDM concerts. 

# About Hiper
The initial goal for Hiper app was that users will be able to:
- Interact with Hiper shapes by simply talking through laptop or PC’s microphones.
- Seeing how Hiper reacts to the pre-loaded files and enjoying music together with Hiper.
- When playing music and sound with other devices (cellphone, speakers ets), users will be able to see how Hiper shapes response to the outside sounds.
- To actually “read” and "see" the differences of beats and frequencies of a sound through Hiper.

Current stage of Hiper app development:
- Users will be able to see a welcome page to Hiper app.
- Users will be able to click the “play” button and enter the Hiper app.
- Users will be able to see one out of four Hiper shapes by clicking anywhere on the screen.
- Hiper shapes include: 
    #1. Hi - Hi Hiper!
    #2. Linear Mercury
    #3. Purple Sun
    #4. Folding Peony
- Users will be able to hear a sound that is connected to Hiper shape.
- Users will be able to see the features and the changes a Hiper shape made at the same time when they click anywhere of the page.
